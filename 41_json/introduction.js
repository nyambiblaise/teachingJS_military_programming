/*
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a format for storing and sending data. It's very commonly used on the web because it's lightweight. Here's an example of a JSON object in an example file called person.json:
 */
{
    "firstName": "Sam",
    "lastName": "Green",
    "age": 24
}
const person = {
    firstName: "Sam",
    lastName: "Green",
    age: 24
};
