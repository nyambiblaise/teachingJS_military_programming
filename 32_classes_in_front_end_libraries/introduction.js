/*
This chapter will show class usage examples in front-end libraries/frameworks.
This chapter won't explain the libraries/frameworks and how they work but rather show you how classes are being used to create reusable components. If you've never used these libraries/frameworks, you can just glance over the lessons and come back to it later if necessary.

The goal of it is to show you how classes are used in real life. Note, that the examples are not guaranteed to be 100% correct or up to date. Instead, think of them a bit as pseudo-code.

We'll cover the following libraries/frameworks:

React (without hooks)
Angular
Web Components
Lit (two small introductory chapters are available at the end of this course).
You can decide to read the lessons that you think will be relevant to you. At the end of the chapter, we'll have a "Fake" front-end library to show you the gist of how things work.
