            When you're building forms with textboxes, you will often need to read what the user has written inside of each one of these textboxes. For example, say you ask the user for their email and you want to double-check that they've given you a valid email, or that they have at least written something in that field.
        </p>
    </div>
<div class="two">
    <form>
        <input type="email" id="email" placeholder="Enter your email">
        <input type="submit" value="Register">
    </form>
    <p>
        <strong id="data"></strong>
    </p>
    <p id="pen">
        You can't use the textContent or innerHTML properties because the <input> element does not have a closing tag.<br><br>
        To read the written content of an input element, you have to use <b>value</b> property:
    </p>
</div>
</body>

<script>
    const d = document.querySelector("data");
