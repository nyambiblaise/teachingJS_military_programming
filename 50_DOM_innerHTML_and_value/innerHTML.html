<!--
We learned in the previous chapter that the textContent property returns the text written inside a tag (for example, a div, h1, p, or other elements).

Sometimes textContent is not enough and you may find yourself needing to use innerHTML.

Let's take a look at an example:
-->
<div id="test">This is a sample text</div>

<script>
    const txt = document.querySelector("#test");
    console.log(txt.innerHTML);
</script>
