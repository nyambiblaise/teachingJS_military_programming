<!--
We learned in the previous chapter that the textContent property returns the text written inside a tag (for example, a div, h1, p, or other elements).

Sometimes textContent is not enough and you may find yourself needing to use innerHTML.

we use the querySelector and not the querySelectorAll.
-->
<div id="test">This is a sample text</div>

<script>
    const txt = document.querySelector("#test");
    console.log(txt.innerHTML);

    /*
    So far, there's no difference between textContent and innerHTML that's because this element does not contain any HTML elements.
     */
