<input type="email" id="email" placeholder="Enter your email" value="">

<p>
    Say you already know the email of the user, and you want to pre-fill the textbox to make their life easier. You can do that by setting the value attribute:
</p>
<hr>
<p>
    Textareas (the textarea> element) is an exception. It is not a self-closing tag but you have to use value instead of textContent.

So, as a rule of thumb, whenever you'd like to read the value written inside of an input>, a select>, or a textarea> you have to access the value property.

<script>
    const t = document.querySelector("#email");
    t.value="pop@gmail.com";
</script>
