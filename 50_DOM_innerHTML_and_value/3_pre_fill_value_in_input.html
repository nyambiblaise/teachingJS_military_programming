<input type="email" id="email" placeholder="Enter your email" value="sam@example.com">

<p>
    Say you already know the email of the user, and you want to pre-fill the textbox to make their life easier. You can do that by setting the value attribute:
</p>
<script>
    const t = document.querySelector("#email");
    t.value="pop@gmail.com";
</script>
