- element.innerHTML returns the HTML inside the element, whereas element.textContent returns the text (with the HTML stripped out).

- When changing element.innerHTML be careful to never trust user input.

- You should avoid changing the value of element.innerHTML when the value you're changing to can be manipulated by the user.
- You can empty an element by setting its innerHTML or textContent to an empty string (element.innerHTML = "").

- textContent does NOT work on self-closing tags (for example, textboxes)
- Use value to access the text written inside an <input> element.

- The <textarea> is not self-closing but you still have to access the value property
