<p>
    you can use the element.classList.remove() method to remove a class.<br>
    but a class attribute MUST exist
</p>
<ul id="shopping-list">
    <li id="first-item" class="highlighted vegetables">Carrots</li>
    <li>Avocado</li>
</ul>
<script>
    const elt = document.querySelector("#first-item");
    elt.classList.remove("highlighted"); //at the end, only the class vegetables will be left
</script>

<p>
    1- You can only access .classList on a single element. If you had a NodeList (from document.querySelectorAll), then you need to loop through it with forEach.<br>

    2- To be able to manage classes (in this case remove a class), you have to start by accessing .classList. A common mistake is to try and call ❌element.remove() or ❌element.removeClass() but these methods do not exist.<br>

    3- All the methods under classList expect a class name. So you should not prefix the class name with a dot. ❌element.classList.remove(".highlighted") would not work as expected here.
