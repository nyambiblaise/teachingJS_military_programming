        Instead of actually checking whether a certain class is already present before removing it and checking whether a certain class is not already present before adding it, you can use the built-in toggle method:<br><br>

        Notice how every time you call this toggle method, it either adds or removes the class depending on whether the class was already present on the DOM element or not.
