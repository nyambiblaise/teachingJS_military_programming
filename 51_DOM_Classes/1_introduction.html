<!--
One of the most common use cases when building websites is the need to dynamically add and remove a class on an element.

The classList is a read-only property of an element that returns a live collection of CSS classes:

Even though the classList is read-only, but you can manipulate the classes it contains using various methods.

Every HTML element has a classList object. This classList object allows you to call methods such as add, remove, and other methods that we'll learn about in the next lesson.

It's isage is: element.classList.add(className)
-->
<ul id="shopping-list">
    <li id="first-item">Carrots</li>
    <li>Avocado</li>
</ul>
<!-- with the above code, we can add the class "highlighted" to Carrots -->

<script>
    const element = document.querySelector("#first-item");
    element.classList.add("#highlisted");

    /*
    The <li id="first-item">Carrots</li> element becomes <li id="first-item" class="highlighted">Carrots</li>.

1- You can only access .classList on a single element. If you had a NodeList (from document.querySelectorAll), then you need to loop through it with forEach.

2- To be able to manage classes (in this case add a class), you have to start by accessing .classList. A common mistake is to try and call ❌element.add() or ❌element.addClass() but these methods do not exist.

3- All the methods under classList expect a class name. So you should not prefix the class name with a dot. element.classList.add(".highlighted") would not work as expected here.
