You should use document.querySelector() whenever you want to select one element from the DOM.

document.getElementById("element-id") works similarly to document.querySelector("CSS-SELECTOR") except that it only expects an id so it can only find elements by id.

This means that these 2 code snippets will return the same element:
--->
<div id="navbar">

</div>
<script>
    const nav = document.querySelector("#navbar");
    const nav2 = document.getElementById("navbar");

    //both should work the same way, so it all depends on you.
    //Notice how the only difference is the # because querySelector expects any CSS selector whereas getElementById only expects an id.
</script>
