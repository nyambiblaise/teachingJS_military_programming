We know that NodeList only supports .length and .forEach(), but what if for some reason you want to use .map() or .filter()?

As you can see, you can convert a NodeList into an array using the array spread syntax (...) which spreads every single item of the NodeList, into a new array.

After doing that, you can then call any array method on its result.

Even though that's not very frequent, it's still quite useful to be able to call .filter() or other array-like methods on NodeList.
To be able to do that, you have to convert the NodeList into an Array.
