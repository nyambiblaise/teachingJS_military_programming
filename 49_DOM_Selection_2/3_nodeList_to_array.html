We know that NodeList only supports .length and .forEach(), but what if for some reason you want to use .map() or .filter()?

Even though that's not very frequent, it's still quite useful to be able to call .filter() or other array-like methods on NodeList.
To be able to do that, you have to convert the NodeList into an Array.
