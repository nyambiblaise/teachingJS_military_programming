<!--
document.querySelectorAll(cssSelector) returns a NodeList. A NodeList is a collection of DOM elements.

A NodeList is not an array. However, there are some similarities:

they both have a length property (you can access it with .length)
you can access items at a specific index with the square brackets. For example, [0] and [1].
you can iterate through both of them with .forEach().

<p>First paragraph</p>
<p>Second paragraph</p>

<script>
    const nb = document.querySelectorAll("p");
    console.log(`There are ${nb} ps`)

    nb.forEach(data=>{
        console.log(data.textContent);
    })
</script>
