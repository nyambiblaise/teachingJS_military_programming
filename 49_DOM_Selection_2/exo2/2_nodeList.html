<!--
document.querySelectorAll(cssSelector) returns a NodeList. A NodeList is a collection of DOM elements.

A NodeList is not an array. However, there are some similarities:

they both have a length property (you can access it with .length)
you can access items at a specific index with the square brackets. For example, [0] and [1].
you can iterate through both of them with .forEach().
-->
<p>First paragraph 1</p>
<p>Second paragraph 2</p>

<script>
    const nb = document.querySelectorAll("p");
    console.log(`length is ${nb}`);
    console.log(`First paragraph is ${nb[0].textContent}`);
    console.log(`Second paragraph is ${nb[1].textContent}`);

    nb.forEach(data=>{
        console.log(data.textContent);
    })
</script>
