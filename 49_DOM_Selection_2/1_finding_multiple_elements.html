<!--
we use the document.querySelectorAll() to get all the elements that match the specific selector
-->
<p id="first">First paragraph</p>
<p id="second">Second paragraph</p>
<script>
 const sel = document.querySelectorAll("p");
 //console.log(`data is ${sel}`);
 sel.forEach(a=>{
  console.log(a.textContent);

 /*
 While document.querySelector() might return null (when no items are found), the document.querySelectorAll() will always return a NodeList. This is an important difference.

A NodeList is a collection of DOM elements. This means that it is a variable that contains several DOM elements.

The NodeList object is similar to an array, but it's not an array.
