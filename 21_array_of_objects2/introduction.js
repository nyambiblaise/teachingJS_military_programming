/*
In this lesson, we'll take a look at some of the array methods that we've seen and their usage with arrays of objects.
Again, there's nothing particularly new, but the extra challenges help simulate common problems you run into in
 real-life projects.

All the examples in this lesson will use the following tweets variable:
 */
const tweets = [
    {
        id: 10512,
        message: "Hello Twitter ðŸ‘‹",
        stats: {
            likes: 41,
            retweets: 54
        }
    },
    {
        id: 41241,
        message: "How do you keep track of your notes?",
        stats: {
            likes: 14,
            retweets: 20
        }
    },
    {
        id: 41441,
        message: "This is awesome, man!!!",
        stats: {
            likes: 7,
            retweets: 32
        }
    },
    {
        id: 40941,
        message: "This is awesome, man!!!",
        stats: {
            likes: 50,
            retweets: 0
        }
    }
];
/*1 - Sort all tweets with more than 30 likes
Calling the .filter() method on an array of objects will return an array containing the objects that pass the condition you specify in the callback.
 */
const getTweetsMoreThan30Likes = someTweets =>{
    return someTweets.filter(t=>t.stats.likes>30);
}
console.log(getTweetsMoreThan30Likes(tweets));

/*2 - Search for a tweet with id 40941
Calling the .find() method on an array of objects will return the first object that matches the condition you specify in the callback, or undefined if no objects satisfy the condition.
 */
const search = 40941;
const findTweetById = (searchID)=>{
    return tweets.find(tweet=>tweet.id===searchID);
}
console.log(findTweetById(search));

/*3 - Check if some tweets have had more than x likes
Calling the .some() method on an array of objects will return true when at least one item in the array satisfies the condition you specified in the callback. Otherwise, it returns false.
 */
const checkIfHugeRetweets = (nbOfLikes)=>{
    return tweets.some(t => t.stats.likes >= nbOfLikes);
}
console.log(checkIfHugeRetweets(10)); //true cause there is a tweet with >10 likes
console.log(checkIfHugeRetweets(50)); //true cause there is a tweet with >=50 likes
console.log(checkIfHugeRetweets(54)); //false cause there is no tweet with >=54 likes

/*4 - Check if every tweet has at least one retweet
Calling the .every() method on an array of objects will return true when every item in the array satisfies the condition you specified in the callback. Otherwise, it returns false.
 */
const checkIfTweetHasRetweet = ()=>{
    return tweets.every(t => t.stats.retweets >0);
}
console.log(checkIfTweetHasRetweet())
