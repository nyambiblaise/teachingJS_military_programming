/*
A promise can have 3 states:
pending, fulfilled and rejected
When you create a promise, it will start in the pending state. When it has been completed successfully, then it becomes in the fulfilled state.

So, when the promise becomes fulfilled, the callback passed to .then(callback) will execute.
