/*
Take a look at the getWeatherDescription function (in exo_weather_question.js) that expects a city name (only
 Amsterdam or Tokyo) and resolves the weather description after a while.

Implement the logWeatherDescription such that it uses getWeatherDescription to log the weather description to the console.
Look at the sample usage to see the expected result.
logWeatherDescription("Amsterdam"); //will log "Cloudy"
logWeatherDescription("Tokyo"); // will log "Sunny"

import {getWeatherDescription} from "./exo_weather_question.js";

const logWeatherDescription = cityName=>{

logWeatherDescription("tokyo");
logWeatherDescription("douala");
logWeatherDescription("amsterdam");
