/*
Take a look at the getWeatherDescription function (in exo_weather_question.js) that expects a city name (only
 Amsterdam or Tokyo) and resolves the weather description after a while.

Implement the logWeatherDescription such that it uses getWeatherDescription to log the weather description to the console.
Look at the sample usage to see the expected result.
