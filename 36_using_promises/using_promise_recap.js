/*
A promise can have 3 states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
Every promise starts with the pending state and then becomes fulfilled when it has been completed successfully.
Promises let you run a callback sometime in the future when the promise has been completed successfully.
When a promise completes successfully, you will often hear/read people say that it has resolved.
One of the most useful features of promises is when they resolve with some data, an answer of some computation or some values coming from an external service/API.
You are not able to extract the value resolved by a promise outside of a promise.
Don't rush into learning async/await yet. You have to have solid experience in promises first.
