/*
There are no tasks and no tests in this challenge. All you have to do is visualize in the console the value of total, current, and finally the sum. Notice how:

the value of total starts at 0 (which is given by the initialValue)
the value of current a single item of the array for every iteration.
the value of total is the result of the last run of the reducer (the ongoing sum)
