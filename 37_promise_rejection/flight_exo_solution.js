/*
Use the fakeFetch function from flight_exo_question.js that takes a string as a parameter. This fake fetch only
 handles the "flight-status" for now. However, we want you to use it to get the "user-details".
This will fail at the moment since it's not implemented so make sure to handle the rejected case.

In the future, once we implement user-details, the code will automatically work because the promise will not reject.
