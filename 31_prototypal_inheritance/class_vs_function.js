/*
You can think of the prototype as an object that contains all the instance methods that a certain function can have.
 This prototype is linked in what we call the prototype chain. This is explained in the file prototype_chain.js

So by assigning a new function to Rectangle.prototype you are adding a new instance method to the instances of Rectangle.
That means, every time you create a new Rectangle, that instance will have an instance method called isSquare which can access the instance properties via this. (for example, this.width and this.length).

String.prototype.trim().
What this means is that trim() is a method that can be called on instances of String. This means, trim() can be called on any new string that you create.
