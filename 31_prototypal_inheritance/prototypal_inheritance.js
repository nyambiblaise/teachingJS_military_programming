/*
Prototypal inheritance is here to solve the problem in traditional inheritance whereby when you want to inhreit from
 a class, all the method of that class are inherited. Here, you may opt to inherit just specific methods in a class.

 Let us assume we have the following classes and their methods:
 Jungle
 - rain()
 - growTree();

 Gorilla
 - sleep()
 - eat()
